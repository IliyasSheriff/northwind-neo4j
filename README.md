|`orders.csv`|product orders|`(:Order)`|
|`products.csv`|products sold by Northwind|`(:Product)`|

## Using the Neo4j Import Tool

Import Tool Considerations

* All files must use the same delimiter
* Files can be repeatedly used for both nodes and relationships.
* Files can be compressed.
* Data can optionally be provided using multiple files
* A header which provides information on the data fields must precede each input
* Fields without corresponding information in the header will not be read.
* UTF-8 encoding is used.
* Indexes are not created during the import. 
* Bulk import is only available for initial seeding of a database.

### Groups

The import tool assumes that node identifiers are unique across node files.
If this isnâ€™t the case then we can define groups. Groups are defined as part of the ID field of node files.
For example, to specify the Person group we would use the field header ID(Person) in our persons node file.
We also need to reference that exact group in our relationships file i.e. `START_ID(Person)` or `END_ID(Person)`.

In this example, the `suppliers.csv` header would be modified to include a *group* for Supplier nodes:

Original Header:

```
supplierID,companyName,contactName,contactTitle,...
```

Modified Header:

```
id:ID(Supplier),companyName,contactName,contactTitle,...
```

### Property Types

Property types for nodes and relationships are set in the header file (e.g. `:int`, `:string`, `:ignored, et cetera).
In this example, `supplier.csv` be modified like this:

```
id:ID(Supplier),companyName:String,contactName:String,contactTitle:String,...
```

### Labels

Use the `LABEL` header to provide the labels of each node created by a row.
In this example, one could add a column with header `LABEL` and content `Supplier`, `Product`, or whatever the node labels are.
As the `supplier.csv` file represents nodes that have all the same label, the node label can be declared on the command line.
The command below loads just the Supply nodes to a database in a selected directory:

```
neo4j-import --into path_to_target_directory --nodes:Supplier suppliers.csv
```
